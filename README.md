## How to use

### 1. Install dependencies & Deploy the Prisma database API

You have to install the dependencies for the client and the server. In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn install`
`cd server`
`yarn install`
`yarn prisma deploy`

### 2. Start the server

The server will be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

`yarn start`

### 3. Run the app

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app from the root directory. The commands need to be run in a new terminal tab/window inside the root directory react-apollo (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

`yarn start`


This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
